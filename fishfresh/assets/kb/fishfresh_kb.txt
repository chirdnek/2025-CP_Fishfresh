### Project Context — Zamboanga City
Zamboanga City is a major fishing hub. Fishing is woven into daily life and the local economy. Consumers depend on fresh seafood for nutrition and health; trust in vendors and local markets hinges on freshness.

### Why Freshness Matters
Freshness affects safety, taste, texture, and nutrients. Spoiled seafood risks illness. Reliable freshness boosts consumer trust and loyalty and supports higher-value trade.

### Problem with Traditional Checks
Current checks (eyes, gill smell/color, skin/flesh feel) are subjective and inconsistent. Sellers and buyers may disagree; consumers often lack skill to assess accurately. This causes distrust, unfair pricing, and safety risk.

### Need for an Objective Tool
There’s no quick, universal freshness marker at the point of sale. The city needs a portable, easy-to-use, real-time, objective method that improves safety, trust, and transparency.

### Proposed Solution — FishFresh (Overview)
A mobile computer-vision app analyzes photos of fish (eyes, gills, skin/shine) to produce an objective freshness score. Runs on a smartphone camera; provides consistent guidance at markets and groceries.

### How FishFresh Works (High-level)
1) Capture fish photo (good lighting, steady phone).  
2) Model analyzes eye clarity, gill color, skin/shine.  
3) App outputs an easy, objective score (and label like Fresh / Semi-fresh / Not fresh).  
4) Users make safer, more confident purchases; vendors benefit from trust and fair pricing.

### Benefits to Users & Community
• Safer food choices and fewer spoiled purchases.  
• Confidence and fairness in pricing.  
• Less waste; more trust in local seafood.  
• Simple, portable tool—no expertise needed.

### General Problem Statement
The city lacks an objective, accurate, readily available method to determine fish freshness, causing inconsistency, reduced trust, and inefficiency.

### Specific Problems
1) Subjective human judgment leads to disagreement and unreliability.  
2) Computer vision/mobile methods are not yet broadly used in local markets.  
3) Some target users (e.g., fishermen, market sellers) have low technical literacy.  
4) Local studies lack robust visual-signal identification (eyes/gills/skin) for freshness.  
5) No scientific tool → unfair prices, lost trust, and higher post-harvest losses.

### Purpose & Description of FishFresh
Provide an ergonomic, objective, phone-based freshness score so buyers can avoid unsafe/low-quality fish and pay fairly. Supports faster, transparent transactions and improves market trust.

### What Makes It Novel
Brings computer vision directly to consumers’ phones; replaces subjective eyeballing with consistent, data-driven scoring; tackles a daily, real-world pain point in local markets.

### Primary Objective
Build and evaluate a real-time mobile app that scans fish freshness and replaces subjective judgment with a standard, measurable approach.

### Specific Objectives
• Use visual features (eye clarity, gill color, skin brightness) to assess freshness.  
• Build a mobile app to capture and analyze fish images.  
• Integrate a trained model for ~3–5s analysis per scan.  
• Design an algorithm to output a clear, objective freshness score.

### Scope
Mobile app for consumers/buyers in Zamboanga City at point-of-sale (markets/grocers). Features: image capture, CV model inference, and simple result UI. No special skills needed.

### Limitations
• No IoT hardware; mobile only.  
• Visual-only freshness (not pre-catch or long-term storage factors).  
• Not for chopped/cut fish.  
• Trained for common local species; exotic/rare species out of scope.  
• Camera quality and lighting can affect performance.

### Significance of the Study
Shows practical AI/CV for food quality; improves public health and market transparency; empowers ordinary consumers; supports sustainable, trustworthy seafood trade in the community.

### Definitions (selected)
Mobile Operating System — phone platform that provides camera/compute for the app.  
Computer Vision — AI that interprets images/video.  
Fish Freshness Assessment — evaluating quality/decay stage.  
Image Processing — computational transforms to enhance/extract info.  
Artificial Intelligence — systems performing tasks needing human-like intelligence.  
Machine Learning — AI that learns patterns from data without explicit rules.  
Freshness Indicators — measurable signals that reflect food freshness.  
Spoilage — process of decay in food.  
Subjective Assessment — evaluation based on personal judgment.  
Objective Assessment — evaluation based on measurable, unbiased criteria.

### Related Work — Highlights
• Wavelet/gill analysis can classify freshness (non-destructive) with high accuracy.  
• Eye-image analysis via DL+ML (MobileNetV2, VGG16, ResNet50 with SVM/ANN/LR) achieved up to ~100% on specific datasets.  
• K-NN with image features (RGB/ROI on eyes/gills/skin) works in mobile settings.  
• YOLOv5/Faster-R-CNN for eye detection; YOLOv5 hit ~99.3% on a freshness dataset.  
• Hyperspectral imaging is powerful in labs, but less practical for mobile retail use.

### Synthesis
Literature shows subjective checks can be replaced by AI on visual cues (eyes/gills/skin). Mobile apps can deliver real-time, non-destructive, accurate assessments. This underpins FishFresh’s feasibility and value for post-harvest quality in local markets.
